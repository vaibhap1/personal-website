I am a research scientist working in the Personalized modeling team at Clearsense LLC. I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California Irvine, working with Dr. Ramesh Jain at Social Life Networks Lab, and did my bachelor's in Computer Science at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. 
During my tenure as a graduate student, I have published my research findings at internationally acclaimed venues and journals such as Nature, ACM Multimedia, ACM RecSys, and International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval. My research is focused on developing systems and algorithms that leverage user-generated data (e.g. from wearable devices and smartphones) to understand their health and lifestyle.
I also have three years of professional experience in predictive modeling and data science projects in Health insurance, Retail chain, and credit risk analysis domains.
